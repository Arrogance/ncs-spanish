 # ATTENTION MOD TRANSLATORS:
 # Each time this file is updated, listed in this commented out box will be a listing of all localisation file changes with the mod version it's for at the top.
 # There there will be NEW or CHANGED that tells you want happened to each line in this file. Example: you'll see "NEW: 1, 2, 3..." which tells you which lines are new.
 # DELETED lines will be given in full to make sure you know exactly what to delete since it won't be in this version of the file.
 # If a change to this file isn't included in the NEW/CHANGED/DELETE anywhere, then it's "FIXED" for the reference coding (the blue wording that comes first).
 # If the NEW/CHANGED/DELETED/FIXED lines are completely blank, there are ZERO changes in localisation for that release.

 # Localisation Update Log: Mod Version 3.0.10

 # NEW:
 # CHANGED:
 # DELETED:
 # FIXED:	Deleted all :0 and :1, replacing them with just : since they are not required and are not proper syntax.
